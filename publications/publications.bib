  abstract = "Abstract Renewable energy is the cornerstone of preventing
              dangerous climate change whilst maintaining a robust energy
              supply. Tidal energy will arguably play a critical role in the
              renewable energy portfolio as it is both predictable and
              reliable, and can be put in place across the globe. However,
              installation may impact the local and regional ecology via
              changes in tidal dynamics, sediment transport pathways or
              bathymetric changes. In order to mitigate these effects, tidal
              energy devices need to be modelled in order to predict
              hydrodynamic changes. Robust mesh generation is a fundamental
              component required for developing simulations with high accuracy.
              However, mesh generation for coastal domains can be an elaborate
              procedure. Here, we describe an approach combining mesh
              generators with Geographical Information Systems. We demonstrate
              robustness and efficiency by constructing a mesh with which to
              examine the potential environmental impact of a tidal turbine
              farm installation in the Orkney Islands. The mesh is then used
              with two well-validated ocean models, to compare their flow
              predictions with and without a turbine array. The results
              demonstrate that it is possible to create an easy-to-use tool to
              generate high-quality meshes for combined coastal engineering,
              here tidal turbines, and coastal ocean simulations.",

  abstract = "This paper introduces a new approach for investigating trade-offs
              between different societal objectives in the design of
              tidal-turbine arrays. This method is demonstrated through the
              trade-off between the yield of an array, and the extent to which
              that array alters the flow. This is posed as a multi-objective
              optimisation problem, and the problem is investigated using the
              array layout optimisation tool OpenTidalFarm. Motivated by
              environmental concerns, OpenTidalFarm is adapted to not only
              maximise array yield but also to minimise the effect of the array
              upon the hydrodynamics of the region, specifically the flow
              velocity. A linear scalarisation of the multi-objective
              optimisation problem is solved for a series of different
              weightings of the two conflicting objectives. Two idealised test
              scenarios are evaluated and in each case a set of Pareto
              solutions is found. These arrays are assessed for the power they
              generate and the severity of change they cause in the flow
              velocity. These analyses allow for the identification of
              trade-offs between these two objectives, while the methods
              proposed can similarly be applied to the two key societal
              objectives of energy production and conservation, thus providing
              information that could be valuable to stakeholders and

              (Sutherland) that we combine with other studies from the region.
              Following deglaciation, RSL fell from a Lateglacial highstand of
              +6−8 m OD (Ordnance Datum = ca. mean sea level) at ca. 15 k cal a
              BP to below present, then rose to an early Holocene highstand and
              remained at ca. +1 m OD between ca. 7 and 3 k cal a BP, before
              falling to present. We find no evidence for significant
              differential Holocene glacio-isostatic adjustment between sites
              on the north-west (Lochinver, Loch Laxford), north (Loch Eriboll)

              can be used to identify the important factors in determining wave
              characteristics. Here we use Fluidity, an open source finite
              element code, to simulate waves generated by deformable submarine
              slides. Fluidity uses flexible unstructured meshes combined with
              adaptivity which alters the mesh topology and resolution based on
              the simulation state, focussing or reducing resolution, when and
              where it is required. Fluidity also allows a number of different
              numerical approaches to be taken to simulate submarine slide
              deformation, free-surface representation, and wave generation
              within the same numerical framework. In this work we use a
              multi-material approach, considering either two materials (slide
              and water with a free surface) or three materials (slide, water
              and air), as well as a sediment model (sediment, water and free
              surface) approach. In all cases the slide is treated as a viscous
              fluid. Our results are shown to be consistent with laboratory
              experiments using a deformable submarine slide, and demonstrate
              good agreement when compared with other numerical models. The
              three different approaches for simulating submarine slide
              dynamics and tsunami wave generation produce similar waveforms
              and slide deformation geometries. However, each has its own
              merits depending on the application. Mesh adaptivity is shown to
              be able to reduce the computational cost without compromising the
              accuracy of results.",

              margins. We have discovered seven landslides along the shelf edge
              and upper slope of the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR),
              Australia. The largest shelf edge landslide is investigated in
              detail and represents a collapse of a 7 km long section of the
              shelf edge at 90 m water depth with coarse debris deposited up to
              5.5 km away on the upper slope down to 250 m. The precise timing
              and triggering mechanisms are uncertain but available chronologic
              and seismic stratigraphic evidence suggests that this event
              occurred during the last deglacial sea-level rise between 20 and
              14 ka. Regional bathymetric data confirms that these shelf edge
              and upper slope slides are restricted to the central GBR between
              latitude 18° and 19°S, suggesting a spatial relationship between
              the extensive Burdekin paleo-fluvial/delta system and shallow

              mechanism for the generation of tsunamis on this margin type, and
              numerical simulations under present conditions confirm that a 2
              to 3 m tsunami wave could be produced locally. However, we
              consider that the risk of such slides, and their resulting
              tsunamis, to the modern coastline is negligible due to their
              relatively small size and the capacity of the GBR to dissipate

              km3), tsunamigenic slide off the coast of Norway. The resulting
              tsunami had run-up heights of around 10--20 m on the Norwegian
              coast, over 12 m in Shetland, 3--6 m on the Scottish mainland
              coast and reached as far as Greenland. Accurate numerical
              simulations of Storegga require high spatial resolution near the
              coasts, particularly near tsunami run-up observations, and also
              in the slide region. However, as the computational domain must
              span the whole of the Norwegian-Greenland sea, employing
              uniformly high spatial resolution is computationally prohibitive.
              To overcome this problem, we present a multiscale numerical model
              of the Storegga slide-generated tsunami where spatial resolution
              varies from 500 m to 50 km across the entire Norwegian-Greenland
