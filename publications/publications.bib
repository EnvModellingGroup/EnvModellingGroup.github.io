  abstract = "Abstract Renewable energy is the cornerstone of preventing
              dangerous climate change whilst maintaining a robust energy
              supply. Tidal energy will arguably play a critical role in the
              renewable energy portfolio as it is both predictable and
              reliable, and can be put in place across the globe. However,
              installation may impact the local and regional ecology via
              changes in tidal dynamics, sediment transport pathways or
              bathymetric changes. In order to mitigate these effects, tidal
              energy devices need to be modelled in order to predict
              hydrodynamic changes. Robust mesh generation is a fundamental
              component required for developing simulations with high accuracy.
              However, mesh generation for coastal domains can be an elaborate
              procedure. Here, we describe an approach combining mesh
              generators with Geographical Information Systems. We demonstrate
              robustness and efficiency by constructing a mesh with which to
              examine the potential environmental impact of a tidal turbine
              farm installation in the Orkney Islands. The mesh is then used
              with two well-validated ocean models, to compare their flow
              predictions with and without a turbine array. The results
              demonstrate that it is possible to create an easy-to-use tool to
              generate high-quality meshes for combined coastal engineering,
              here tidal turbines, and coastal ocean simulations.",

  abstract = "This paper introduces a new approach for investigating trade-offs
              between different societal objectives in the design of
              tidal-turbine arrays. This method is demonstrated through the
              trade-off between the yield of an array, and the extent to which
              that array alters the flow. This is posed as a multi-objective
              optimisation problem, and the problem is investigated using the
              array layout optimisation tool OpenTidalFarm. Motivated by
              environmental concerns, OpenTidalFarm is adapted to not only
              maximise array yield but also to minimise the effect of the array
              upon the hydrodynamics of the region, specifically the flow
              velocity. A linear scalarisation of the multi-objective
              optimisation problem is solved for a series of different
              weightings of the two conflicting objectives. Two idealised test
              scenarios are evaluated and in each case a set of Pareto
              solutions is found. These arrays are assessed for the power they
              generate and the severity of change they cause in the flow
              velocity. These analyses allow for the identification of
              trade-offs between these two objectives, while the methods
              proposed can similarly be applied to the two key societal
              objectives of energy production and conservation, thus providing

                 framework to demonstrate that speciation rate is correlated

              Following deglaciation, RSL fell from a Lateglacial highstand of
              +6−8 m OD (Ordnance Datum = ca. mean sea level) at ca. 15 k cal a

              remained at ca. +1 m OD between ca. 7 and 3 k cal a BP, before

              can be used to identify the important factors in determining wave
              characteristics. Here we use Fluidity, an open source finite
              element code, to simulate waves generated by deformable submarine
              slides. Fluidity uses flexible unstructured meshes combined with
              adaptivity which alters the mesh topology and resolution based on
              the simulation state, focussing or reducing resolution, when and
              where it is required. Fluidity also allows a number of different
              numerical approaches to be taken to simulate submarine slide
              deformation, free-surface representation, and wave generation
              within the same numerical framework. In this work we use a
              multi-material approach, considering either two materials (slide

              and air), as well as a sediment model (sediment, water and free
              surface) approach. In all cases the slide is treated as a viscous
              fluid. Our results are shown to be consistent with laboratory
              experiments using a deformable submarine slide, and demonstrate
              good agreement when compared with other numerical models. The
              three different approaches for simulating submarine slide
              dynamics and tsunami wave generation produce similar waveforms
              and slide deformation geometries. However, each has its own

              and upper slope of the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR),
              Australia. The largest shelf edge landslide is investigated in
              detail and represents a collapse of a 7 km long section of the
              shelf edge at 90 m water depth with coarse debris deposited up to
              5.5 km away on the upper slope down to 250 m. The precise timing
              and triggering mechanisms are uncertain but available chronologic
              and seismic stratigraphic evidence suggests that this event
              occurred during the last deglacial sea-level rise between 20 and

              consider that the risk of such slides, and their resulting
              tsunamis, to the modern coastline is negligible due to their

              were originally composed of aragonite, an unstable polymorph of
              calcium carbonate, and such fossils are typically prone to
              dissolution; the occurrence of a rich association of aragonitic
              shells in a condensed bed is highly unusual. Aragonite
              dissolution occurs when pore-water pH is reduced by the
              oxidization of hydrogen sulphide close to the sediment-water
              interface. Evidence suggests that, in this case, the oxygen
              concentrations in the overlying water column were low during
              deposition. This inhibited the oxidation of sulphides and the
              associated lowering of pH, allowing aragonite to survive long

  abstract  = "R is a free statistical programming language commonly used for
               the analysis of high-throughput microarray and other data. It is
               currently unable to easily utilise multi processor architectures
               without substantial changes to existing R scripts. Further,
               working with large volumes of data often leads to slow
               processing and even memory allocation faults. A recent survey
               highlighted clustering algorithms as both computation and data
               intensive bottlenecks in post-genomic data analyses. These
               algorithms aim to sort numeric vectors (such as gene expression
               profiles) into groups by minimising vector distances within
               groups and maximising them between groups. This paper describes
               the optimisation and parallelisation of a popular clustering
               algorithm, partitioning around medoids (PAM), for the Simple
               Parallel R INTerface (SPRINT). SPRINT allows R users to exploit
               high performance computing systems without expert knowledge of
               such systems. This paper reports on a serial optimisation of the
               original code and a subsequent parallel implementation. The
               parallel implementation enables the processing of data sets that
               exceed the available physical memory and can yield, depending on
               the data set, over 100-fold increase in performance.",

  abstract = "Abstract The ∼8.15 ka Storegga submarine slide was a large (∼3000
              km3), tsunamigenic slide off the coast of Norway. The resulting
              tsunami had run-up heights of around 10--20 m on the Norwegian
              coast, over 12 m in Shetland, 3--6 m on the Scottish mainland
              coast and reached as far as Greenland. Accurate numerical
              simulations of Storegga require high spatial resolution near the
              coasts, particularly near tsunami run-up observations, and also
              in the slide region. However, as the computational domain must
              span the whole of the Norwegian-Greenland sea, employing
              uniformly high spatial resolution is computationally prohibitive.
              To overcome this problem, we present a multiscale numerical model
              of the Storegga slide-generated tsunami where spatial resolution
              varies from 500 m to 50 km across the entire Norwegian-Greenland
              sea domain to optimally resolve the slide region, important
              coastlines and bathymetric changes. We compare results from our
              multiscale model to previous results using constant-resolution
              models and show that accounting for changes in bathymetry since
              8.15 ka, neglected in previous numerical studies of the Storegga
              slide-tsunami, improves the agreement between the model and
              inferred run-up heights in specific locations, especially in the
              Shetlands, where maximum run-up height increased from 8 m (modern
              bathymetry) to 13 m (palaeobathymetry). By tracking the Storegga
              tsunami as far south as the southern North sea, we also found
              that wave heights were high enough to inundate Doggerland, an
              island in the southern North Sea prior to sea level rise over the
              last 8 ka.",

               processing of thousands of individual phylogenies to create

               Such large phylogenies are useful for macroevolutionary studies,
               comparative biology and in conservation and biodiversity. No
               easy to use and fully integrated software package currently

               Python-based software package that uses well defined XML schema
               to manage both data and metadata. It builds on previous versions
               by 1) including new processing steps, such as Safe Taxonomic
               Reduction, 2) using a user-friendly GUI that guides the user to
               complete at least the minimum information required and includes
               context-sensitive documentation, and 3) a revised storage format
               that integrates both tree- and meta-data into a single file.
               These data can then be manipulated according to a well-defined,

                 measurement of thousands to millions of genes or sequences
                 across tens to thousands of different samples. The analysis of
                 the resulting data tests the limits of existing bioinformatics
                 computing infrastructure. A solution to this issue is to use
                 High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, which contain many
                 processors and more memory than desktop computer systems. Many
                 biostatisticians use R to process the data gleaned from
                 microarray analysis and there is even a dedicated group of
                 packages, Bioconductor, for this purpose. However, to exploit
                 HPC systems, R must be able to utilise the multiple processors
                 available on these systems. There are existing modules that
                 enable R to use multiple processors, but these are either
                 difficult to use for the HPC novice or cannot be used to solve
                 certain classes of problems. A method of exploiting HPC
                 systems, using R, but without recourse to mastering parallel
                 programming paradigms is therefore necessary to analyse
                 genomic data to its fullest. RESULTS: We have designed and
                 built a prototype framework that allows the addition of
                 parallelised functions to R to enable the easy exploitation of
                 HPC systems. The Simple Parallel R INTerface (SPRINT) is a
                 wrapper around such parallelised functions. Their use requires
                 very little modification to existing sequential R scripts and
                 no expertise in parallel computing. As an example we created a
                 function that carries out the computation of a pairwise
                 calculated correlation matrix. This performs well with SPRINT.
                 When executed using SPRINT on an HPC resource of eight
                 processors this computation reduces by more than three times
                 the time R takes to complete it on one processor. CONCLUSION:
                 SPRINT allows the biostatistician to concentrate on the
                 research problems rather than the computation, while still
                 allowing exploitation of HPC systems. It is easy to use and
                 with further development will become more useful as more
                 functions are added to the framework.",

                 biological research. One method of creating such large
                 phylogenies is the supertree method, but creating supertrees
                 containing thousands of taxa, and hence providing a
                 comprehensive phylogeny, requires hundred or even thousands of
                 source input trees. Managing and processing these data in a
                 systematic and error-free manner is challenging and will
                 become even more so as supertrees contain ever increasing
                 numbers of taxa. Protocols for processing input source
                 phylogenies have been proposed to ensure data quality, but no
                 robust software implementations of these protocols as yet
                 exist. FINDINGS: The aim of the Supertree Tool Kit (STK) is to
                 aid in the collection, storage and processing of input source
                 trees for use in supertree analysis. It is therefore
                 invaluable when creating supertrees containing thousands of
                 taxa and hundreds of source trees. The STK is a Perl module
                 with executable scripts to carry out various steps in the
                 processing protocols. In order to aid processing we have added
                 meta-data, via XML, to each tree which contains information
                 such as the bibliographic source information for the tree and
                 how the data were derived, for instance the character data
                 used to carry out the original analysis. These data are
                 essential parts of previously proposed protocols. CONCLUSIONS:
                 The STK is a bioinformatics tool designed to make it easier to
                 process source phylogenies for inclusion in supertree analysis
                 from hundreds or thousands of input source trees, whilst
                 reducing potential errors and enabling easy sharing of such
                 datasets. It has been successfully used to create the largest

              modelling has been growing steadily in the last few years. One
              advanta ge of using unstructured meshes is that one can
              concentrate resolution where it is needed. In addition, dynamic
              adaptive mesh optimisation (DAM O) strategies allow resolution to
              be concentrated when this is required. Despite the advantage that
              DAMO gives in terms of improving the spatia l resolution where
              and when required, small-scale turbulence in the oceans still
              requires parameterisation. A two-equation, generic length scal e
              (GLS) turbulence model (one equation for turbulent kinetic energy
              and another for a generic turbulence length-scale quantity) adds
              this param eterisation and can be used in conjunction with
              adaptive mesh techniques. In this paper, an implementation of the
              GLS turbulence parameterisati on is detailed in a
              non-hydrostatic, finite-element, unstructured mesh ocean model,
              Fluidity-ICOM. The implementation is validated by comparing to
              both a laboratory-scale experiment and real-world observations,
              on both fixed and adaptive meshes. The model performs well,
              matching labora tory and observed data, with resolution being
              adjusted as necessary by DAMO. Flexibility in the prognostic
              fields used to construct the error m etric used in DAMO is
              required to ensure best performance. Moreover, the adaptive mesh
              models perform as well as fixed mesh models in terms of root mean
              square error to observation or theoretical mixed layer depths,

              an intrinsic property of carbonate production generated via the
              interaction of non-linear processes (autocycles). For any forcing
              signal such as eustatic sea-level change, to be detectable in
              stratigraphy its effects must be preserved. Here, a
              deterministic, three-dimensional geological process model is used
              to explore how such cycles are preserved in the geological record
              in the presence of autocyclic processes. Each simulation produced
              cycle thickness distributions that are statistically
              indistinguishable from a theoretical Poisson process, regardless
              of whether auto- or allo-cycles dominated. Spectral analysis of
              depositional time series constructed from idealised geological
              sections showed that all detectable signals occurred within the
              Milankovitch forcing frequency bands, even when no Milankovitch
              forcing was present. Thus, it is deduced that from any geological
              section alone, external forcing signals are detectable but are
              not distinguishable from autocyclically produced signals.
              Interestingly, there is no correlation between the percentage of
              sediment preserved and the accuracy with which signals are
              detectable in the preserved sediment: in some model realisations,
              even with preservation as low as 40\%, the correct forcing signal
              can be detected accurately while, conversely, sections with
              preservation as high as 90\% can have poor signal preservation.
              The reverse can also be true in other models. It is therefore
              concluded that distinguishing allocyclic and autocyclic forcing
              in shallow marine or peritidal carbonate successions is likely to
              be extremely difficult except in cases of extraordinary
              sedimentary preservation and dating accuracy.",

  abstract = "Geological Process Models (GPMs) have been used in the past to
              simulate the distinctive stratigraphies formed in carbonate
              sediments, and to explore the interaction of controls that
              produce heterogeneity. Previous GPMs have only indirectly
              included the supersaturation of calcium carbonate in seawater, a
              key physicochemical control on carbonate production in reef and
              lagoon environments, by modifying production rates based on the
              distance from open marine sources. We here use the residence time
              of water in the lagoon and reef areas as a proxy for the
              supersaturation state of carbonate in a new process model,
              Carbonate GPM. Residence times in the model are calculated using
              a particle-tracking algorithm. Carbonate production is also
              controlled by water depth and wave power dissipation. Once
              deposited, sediment can be eroded, transported and re-deposited
              via both advective and diffusive processes. We show that using
              residence time as a control on production might explain the
              formation of non-ordered, three-dimensional carbonate
              stratigraphies by lateral shifts in the locus of carbonate
              deposition on timescales comparable to so-called 5th-order
              sea-level oscillations. We also show that representing
              supersaturation as a function of distance from open marine
              sources, as in previous models, cannot correctly predict the
              supersaturation distribution over a lagoon due to the intricacies
              of the flow regime.",

  abstract  = "Carbonate sediments are often highly heterogeneous due to the
               numerous factors that control deposition. Several of these
               processes are non-linear, so that depositional stratigraphies
               may consequently form complicated, perhaps even chaotic,
               geometries. Forward modelling can help us to understand the
               interactions between the various processes involved. Here we
               present a new 3D forward model of carbonate production and
               deposition, which is specifically designed to test the
               interactions between the three main depositional controls: light
               intensity, wave power and carbonate supersaturation, the latter
               of which is unique to this model. The results of this analysis
               suggest that it may be impossible to predict in detail the
               stratigraphy of carbonate deposits due to its super-sensitivity
               to initial conditions or controlling parameters. This reinforces
               the conclusions reached using previous process models. However,
               unlike previous models, our model does not explicitly include
               nonlinear biological interactions as a control. Instead it shows
               that similar supersensitive behaviour may originate from
               physicochemical processes alone.",
