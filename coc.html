        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    </header>

	<section class="wrapper style2">

      <p>We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure an that every contributor has an 
	 enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any Hill Environmental Modelling
	 Lab project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all time. We create our
	 culture and our culture is inclusive.<p>
          
      <h3>Outputs and open science</h3>
            
      <p>Where possible all outputs will be published as Open Access (preferably Gold or Diamond OA) and the submitted 
      manuscript be posted on a pre-print server (e.g. <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/">EarthArXiv</a>) prior to 
      publication. Where Gold OA is not possible, the manuscript should be made available
      via Green OA and must be placed in the University of York's PURE system within three months of acceptance.</p>
	
      <p>Authorship on any work will be openly discussed in lab meetings and should include everyone who 
	 contributed significantly to the work being presented. Where conflict arises, Jon Hill will facilitate
	 discussion to resolve the conflict.</p>
	    
     <p>All computers should be backed up. A set of two USB hard drives should be used as a daily automated back-up,
        rotated at regular intervals. Regular backup of important documents (e.g. model set-up files, manuscripts) 
	to the lab group's google drive, the University's google drive or the University servers, preferably 
	via a version control system, e.g. git.</p>
    
      <p>All data should be placed on an appropriate repository with a DOI and published alongside the manuscript wherever possible.
	      Data includes. Suitable examples of repositories include <a href-"https://figshare.com/">FigShare</a> and 
	      <a href="https://www.pangaea.de/about/">Pangaea</a>. Staff and PhD students must also adhere to the 
	      <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/about/departments/support-and-admin/information-services/information-policy/index/research-data-management-policy/">University of
	      York's Research Data Management Policy</a>, which means as well as above, you must add the data to PURE, via the DOI above.</p>
	
      <p>All software and scripts should be developed using Git or other suitable code versioning system, ideally in 
	      an open online environment, such as GitHub. Group members are free to add repositories to this group's or
	      start their own. Code should be released under a suitable, permissive licence, such as LGPL whenever possible.
	Copyright of code developed lies with the University's of York for employees, but remains with the student on 
	      their work and notices should be placed in all source code stating copyright owner and licence.</p>
    
      <h3>Flexible working hours</h3>
    
      <p>The exact hours that members of the lab choose to work is up to them, but each lab member should be on campus
      between the hours of 10am and 4pm most days to facilitate collaborative working. Meetings and events will not be 
      arranged outside these hours. Exceptions for these core hours can be arranged in line with University and Departmental policy.</p>
      
      <p>Avoid sending work-related email outside of 08:00 and 18:00. Use services like <a 
      href="https://www.boomeranggmail.com/">Boomerang</a> or simply write the email     
      and save as a draft, then send in the morning. Please give consideration to the 
      timing of the email with respect to what the recipient needs
      to do, i.e. don't send an email at 17:59 which is needed for a 10:00 meeting the next day. 
      Automated emails, e.g. pull requests, github review request, etc. are fine at any time, but no lab members are 
      required nor should feel obliged to reply to them outside of their typical work hours. See the <a href="http://www.emailcharter.org/">
      Email Charter</a> for some helpful techniques to manage your email.</p>
    
      <p>If you experience any challenges related to flexible working within the lab please contact Jon Hill. 
	All communication will be treated as confidential.</p>
    
      <h3>Inclusivity and diversity</h3>
    
      <p>Jon Hill as head of the Lab, and all lab members, are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless 
      of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, age or 
      religion. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form.</p>

      <p>To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many 
      different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.</li>
      <li>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.</li>
      <li>Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</li>
      <li>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
      race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing 
      photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual 
      attention.</li>
      <li>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Jon will discuss the conduct of lab members who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the 
      Hill Environmental Modelling lab, or how specialised their skill set. 
      If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with Jon, formal processes in line with the
      University of York's procedures will commence.</p>

      <p>To report an issue please contact Jon Hill. All communication will be treated as confidential. If you
      do not feel comfortable contacting Jon directly, feel free to use the anonymous Departmental suggestions
      box or the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/25gt7kCUUVOwgNO93">electronic equivalent</a>.</p>
