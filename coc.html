        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

      <p>We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure an that every contributer has an 
         enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any 
         HillEnvironmentalModelling Lab project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all time.
         Science is hard, and the work of making sure science isn't harder than it needs to be is on all of us. We create our culture
         and our culture is inclusive.<p>

      <p>Jon Hill as head of the Lab, and all lab members, are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless 
      of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or 
      religion. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form.</p>

      <p>We are particularly motivated to support new collaborators, people who are looking to learn and 
      develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.</p>

      <p>To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.</p>

      <p>All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many 
      different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.</p>

      <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributers.</p>

      <p>Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</p>

      <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
      body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing 
      photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual 
      attention.</p>

      <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

      <p>Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the 
      HillEnvironmentalModelling lab, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by Jon Hill. 
      If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with Jon, formal processes in line with the
      University of York's procedures will commence.</p>

      <p>To report an issue please contact Jon Hill. All communication will be treated as confidential. If you
      do not feel comfortable contacting Jon directly, feel free to use the anonymous Departmental suggestions
      box or the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/25gt7kCUUVOwgNO93">electronic equivalent</a>.</p>

      <h3>Flexible working hours</h3>

      <p>The exact hours that members of the lab choose to work is up to them, but each lab member should be on campus
      between the hours of 10am and 4pm most days. We are each welcome to send work-related emails or pull 
      requests over the weekend or late at night, but no lab members are required nor should feel obliged to 
      reply to them outside of their typical work hours.</p>

      <p>Lab members are welcome to work flexibly for any reason within the guidelines set by their contract and University policy. 
      Ideally, all lab members will have at least a few hours each week to overlap with each other and working 10am to 
      4pm as core hours will facilitate that.</p>

      <p>If you experience any challenges related to flexible working within the lab please contact Jon Hill. All communication 
      will be treated as confidential.</p>
			
      <h3>Outputs and open science</h3>
      <p>Where possible all outputs will be published as Open Access (preferably Gold or Diamond OA) and the submitted 
      manuscript be posted on a pre-print server (e.g. <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/">EarthArXiv</a>) prior to 
      publication</a>. Where Gold OA is not possible, the manuscript should be made available
      via Green OA and must be placed in the University of York's PURE system within three months of acceptance.</p>
	
      <p> Authorship on any work will be openly discussed in lab meetings and should include everyone who contributed significantly to
      the work being presented. Where conflict arises, Jon Hill will facilitate discussion to resolve the conflict.</p>
	
      <p>All data should be placed on an appropriate repository with a DOI and published alongside the manuscript wherever possible.
	      Data includes. Suitable examples of repositories include <a href-"https://figshare.com/">FigShare</a> and 
	      <a href="https://www.pangaea.de/about/">Pangaea</a></p>
	
      <p>All software and scripts should be developed using Git or other suitable code versioning system, preferably in 
	      an open online environment, such as GitHub. Group members are free to add repositories to this group's or
	      start their own. Code should be released under a suitable, permissive licence, such as LGPL if possible.
	Copyright of code developed lies with the University's of York for employees, but remains with the student on 
	      their work and notices should be placed in all source code stating copyright owner and licence.</p>
