            <h2>What do we do?</h2>
            <p>The Environmental Modelling Research Group, led by <a href="https://jonxhill.wordpress.com/">Jon Hill</a>, focuses on using the latest numerical technologies 
		    and data to solve environmental problems. As a group we look at natural hazards, such coastal flooding and tsunamis, 
		    as well as sedimentological processes and oceanographic processes, including tides. 
		    We study these in the geological past, present and future. See our <a href="publications/">publications</a> for more details.</p>

                  <i>A simulated tsunami on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia casued by a submarine landslide - the Viper slide. This occurred 14-21 kya and so sea level chnages since than have to be accounted for. More details in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2015.11.008">Webster et al, 2016</a></i>

		   <h2>Software Used</h2>
	   <p>We make use of a wide range of software, some of which is developed by us, with our collaborators, or is freely available. We try to use open-source software wherever we can.</p>
           <h3>Fluidity</h3>
           <p>Fluidity is used in a number of different scientific areas including geophysical fluid dynamics, computational fluid dynamics, ocean modelling and mantle convection. It uses a finite element/control volume method which allows arbitrary movement of the mesh with time dependent problems, allowing mesh resolution to increase or decrease locally according to the current simulated state. It has a wide range of element choices including mixed formulations. There is a lot more information on the <a href="http://fluidityproject.github.io/">Fluidity website.</a> Fluidity is available <a href="https://github.com/FluidityProject/fluidity">here.</a></p>
            
            <h3>qmesh</h3>
            <p>qmesh is a new meshing software package that can integrate with QGIS to make computational meshes for other software ike Telemac, Fluidity, and Thetis. More information on the <a href="http://qmesh.org/">qmesh website</a> and can be downloaded <a href="https://bitbucket.org/qmesh-developers/qmesh">here.</a></p>

            <h3>Thetis</h3>
            <p><a href="http://thetisproject.org/">Thetis</a> is a new modelling tool which like Fluidity is very flexible. Rather than code in C or Fortran, Thetis is written in a very high level <a href="http://www.firedrakeproject.org/"</a>Python abstraction called Firedrake</a> making use of mathematical terms like <i>grad</i> in the code itself. This high level code can then be compiled for a targetted platform.</p>

	   <h3>Carst</h3>
	<p><a href="https://carst-model.github.io/">Carst</a> is a new stratigraphic model that incorporates adjoint solver to invert the model. Very much under development and like Thetis, is based on <a href="http://www.firedrakeproject.org/"</a>Python abstraction called Firedrake</a>.
	   
	   <h3>Supertree Toolkit</h3>
           <p><a href="https://github.com/supertree-toolkit/stk">Supertree Toolkit</a> is a data processing pipeline for Supertree construction. It has been used in a number of publications which carry out macro-evolutionary studies using some of the largest supertrees ever constructed. More information is <a href="http://supertreetoolkit.org/">here.</a></p>

            <h3>R</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is used for a number purposes, including GIS, stats, species distribution modelling and phylogenetic applications.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is our "go-to" tool for writting short scripts to visualise or convert data formats.</p>
